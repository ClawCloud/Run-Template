### Notice

Protect the login address: Set access restrictions to prevent unauthorized direct access.
    
Use a complex password: Create a password that includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to increase cracking difficulty.
    
Avoid common usernames: Refrain from using common usernames like "admin" or "root" to reduce the risk of brute-force attacks.
    
Regularly change passwords: It is recommended to update your password periodically to mitigate security risks associated with long-term usage of the same password.
    
Enable multi-factor authentication: Adopt two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security beyond just the password.
    
Limit login attempts: Set a maximum number of failed login attempts, and temporarily lock the account once it is exceeded to prevent brute-force attacks.
    
Configure unusual login notifications: Set up alerts for abnormal login activity to be informed and respond promptly to potential security issues.
    
Conduct regular security audits: Periodically review account security logs and system configurations to quickly identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
