Komari is a lightweight self-hosted server monitoring tool designed to provide a simple and efficient server performance monitoring solution. It supports viewing server status through a web interface and collecting data through lightweight agents.

### Usage Tips

#### Username and Password

For security purposes, please change the default username and password before using the application formally. Choose a strong and secure password.

#### Adding a Server

After logging in, click the button in the top right corner to enter the management panel. Then, from the left navigation menu, select **Servers** and click **Add Node**.

Enter a name for the server node, then click the **Download** button to get the installation command. Copy and run the command on your target server to install the Agent.

After about one minute, the server information will appear in the list.


### Notice

Protect the login address: Set access restrictions to prevent unauthorized direct access.
    
Use a complex password: Create a password that includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to increase cracking difficulty.
    
Avoid common usernames: Refrain from using common usernames like "admin" or "root" to reduce the risk of brute-force attacks.
    
Regularly change passwords: It is recommended to update your password periodically to mitigate security risks associated with long-term usage of the same password.
    
Enable multi-factor authentication: Adopt two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security beyond just the password.
    
Limit login attempts: Set a maximum number of failed login attempts, and temporarily lock the account once it is exceeded to prevent brute-force attacks.
    
Configure unusual login notifications: Set up alerts for abnormal login activity to be informed and respond promptly to potential security issues.
    
Conduct regular security audits: Periodically review account security logs and system configurations to quickly identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
